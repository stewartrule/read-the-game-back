## Read the Game Back

### Description

GraphQL service for Read the Game Front

A while ago I ran into [this cool design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55747919/read-the-gamecom) made by [Bureau Oberhaeuser](https://oberhaeuser.info/) on Behance, and thought it had some pretty awesome components, so I decided to create the frontend using React, TypeScript and Storybook, and also give [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.ml/) and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) a try for the [GraphQL backend](https://github.com/stewartrule/read-the-game-back).
