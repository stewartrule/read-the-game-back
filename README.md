## Read the Game Back

### Description

GraphQL service for Read the Game Front

Found [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55747919/read-the-gamecom) made by [Bureau Oberhaeuser](https://oberhaeuser.info/) on Behance, and thought it looked pretty awesome, so I decided to build a component library to try out [storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook), and also give [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com) a try for the backend.
