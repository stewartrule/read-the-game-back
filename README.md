## Read the Game Back

### Description

GraphQL service for Read the Game Front

Found [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55747919/read-the-gamecom) made by [Bureau Oberhaeuser](https://oberhaeuser.info/) on Behance, which I thought had some pretty awesome components, so I decided to try out [storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) to build up the [frontend](https://github.com/stewartrule/read-the-game-front), and also give [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.ml/) and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) a try for the GraphQL backend.
